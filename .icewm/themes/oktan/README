IceWM Theme


[ What is special about this theme? ]

Basicly it's a low-color theme. It defaults to use only 8 different
colors. Six grey-scale values one yellow one blue.
But the looks are pretty clean and fresh so you might want to use it on
your oh-so-fat 32-bit (16,7 Mio.) colored box. There are alternate themes
included that are a bit more colorful (with the menus and such).


[ Features in this theme ]

  uses just eight colors:

   $ cat *xpm |grep 'c #' |sort +2 |uniq -f 2  

   "#      c #333333",
   "$      c #666666",
   "#      c #999999",
   "%      c #CCCCCC",
   "+      c #EEEEEE",
   ".      c #FFFFFF",
   "Y      c #FFFF00",

[ Why the name? ]

As you were taught in chemistry class the octane molecule looks something
like:

     H  H  H  H  H  H  H  H
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  H--C--C--C--C--C--C--C--C--H
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
     H  H  H  H  H  H  H  H

see? Eight carbon atoms... thats 'C' like in color... you get it.

( To be precise, our octane (which is part of gasoline) is an
  isooctane. It's named 2,2,4-Trimethylpentan: )

   C

 C - C - C

And no, it's not a reference to OkTAN, the swedish band which
makes music in a combination between 666 and Scooter...
